Welcome to the first open source fundraising toolkit for civic projects. Neighbor.ly began in February 2012 as a fork of the wildly successful Brazillian crowdfunding platform [Catarse](https://github.com/catarse/catarse). Working closely with the developers of that project, Neighbor.ly is building towards a full spectrum fundraising toolkit for civic projects.

## An open source fundraising toolkit for civic projects

This is the source code repository running [Neighbor.ly](http://neighbor.ly). We've decided to open source the code for our platform in the hopes that communities will find it useful as they embrace new funding sources for projects once covered by taxes and bonds.

Communities are always welcome and encouraged to list their projects on [Neighbor.ly](http://neighbor.ly). This codebase is intended for communities who would rather own and operate their own platforms. We also offer consultancy in setting the platform up as a "white label" extension to your exisitng website, and offer a variety of paid licensed versions built specifically for your needs (often easier and almost always cheaper than implementing this yourself). If you are interested in ways we can help you make the most of civic fundraising please [contact us](http://neighbor.ly).


# Getting started

### Internationalization

This software was originally created as [Catarse](https://github.com/catarse/catarse), Brazil's first crowdfunding platform.
It was first made in Portuguese then later English support added by [Daniel Walmsley](http://purpose.com). Neighbor.ly focused on making all aspects of the interface in US English. There are still some patches of both languages throughout the software, but overall there is good infrastructure in place to internationalize to the language of your choice.

### Translations

We hope to offer many languages in the future. So if you decide to implement Neighbor.ly in your own language, please let us know so we can include your language here.

### Payment gateways

Neighbor.ly supports payment gateways through payment engines. Payment engines are extensions to Neighbor.ly that implement a specific payment gateway logic.
The two current supported payment gateways are:

* Balanced Credit Card
* Balanced Bank Account (ACH)

If you have created another payment engine, please contact us so we can link your engine here.

## How to contribute

Please see the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for information on contributing to Neighbor.ly's development.

### Style Guide

Make sure you follow our [style guide](https://github.com/neighborly/guides/).

## Quick Installation

To get everything working, you'll need to have these dependencies installed in your system:

* ImageMagick >= 6.3.5
* PostgreSQL >= 9.3 (with [postgresql-contrib](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/contrib.html))
* Redis >= 2.4
* Ruby 2.1.1

Then, you can run the following commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/neighborly/neighborly.git
$ cd neighborly
$ ./bin/bootstrap
$ foreman start
```

You are now running Neighborly on http://localhost:3000 with sample configuration. If you plan to use it more than just get it running, you should change configuration (check `db/seeds.rb` for examples) and maybe run development seeds:

```bash
$ rails runner db/development_seeds.rb
```

## Other Repositories
